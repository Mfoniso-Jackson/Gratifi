# GratiFi

**Decentralized AI-Powered Dream Funding Platform**  
Helping workers turn aspirations into reality through milestone-based smart contracts, transparent funding, and community support — built on **Polkadot**.

---

## 🚀 Vision
A world where **anyone**, anywhere, can fund their dreams with the help of a transparent, trustless, and AI-assisted platform. GratiFi combines decentralized identity, AI-driven matching, and milestone-based smart contracts to ensure that funding goes directly towards **real, verified goals**.

---

## 🎯 Mission
To empower workers globally — starting with the hospitality industry — to receive direct funding for personal and professional goals, connecting them with a global community of supporters, sponsors, and impact-driven investors.

---

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Create a Dream Profile**  
   Workers define their goal (e.g., “Start a baking business”) and set clear milestones.
   
2. **Get Matched with Supporters**  
   Our AI engine matches dreamers with relevant sponsors, donors, and communities.

3. **Milestone-Based Funding**  
   Funds are locked in smart contracts and released only when milestones are verified.

4. **Storytelling & Impact Tracking**  
   Dreamers share progress via video, attestations, and decentralized identity verification.
